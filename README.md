# Endless-Quest
An RPG focused on battle after battle.

You play as a young budding hero from the town of Gladius, yearning to be the saviour of the world who will bring an end to the Age of Darkness and usher in prosperity. In your travels, you will fight all that evil has to offer -- can you succeed, or will you fall like those before you?
