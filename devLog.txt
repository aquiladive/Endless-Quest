Took the bare bones (particularly the battle aspect) of a text adventure I once made in order to make it a full-on "keep fighting forever" thing.

Version History
## v1.0.1
-> Post the list of enemies before the battle starts so that battle strategy can be decided.
-> Post character HP and MP for each turn. -- added a "Check Status" option for it

Minor fixes:
-> MP costs added to spell usage. Mana increases at a rate of 5 per level.

## v0.0.1
Currently done:
-> Set up the core of the game, with fighting randomly generated enemies. Plot started.
-> Added three basic classes - Warrior, Mage, Rogue. Specialisations considered, subject to change.

Work items

Things to do:
-> Make the save function more than decorative text.
-> For the initialise opponent function, instead give id numbers to monsters that can be used to directly find and pull them into the battle set. (this will be useful when the roster of monsters increases) -- somewhat done, monsterCompendium has been used to initialise, though ID numbers aren't used, just array position
-> Adjust the random battles according to character level. -- in progress, number of opponents has been cut down according to player level
-> Allow for character classes and specialisations. -- in progress
  -> need to add an option for choosing specialisation in the class
-> Change randomised opponents according to area of battle. -- in progress, currently just using a subset of monsters according to the scene the user is at
-> Remove "Defend" from battle options, alternatively replace it with something useful like "use item".

Things to fix:
-> Increase the barrier for levelling up.
-> Standardise effects (between skill compendium and monster compendium, and how they're used in battle.cpp)

Future things:
-> Include alternate language options? Or at least prepare for the possibility by making displayed lines an English language choice.
-> Add MP to monster attacks as well to restrict them, or would that be too complicated to set up?
-> Add a fourth class for Monk? Maybe a fifth for Archer or some similar variant?
