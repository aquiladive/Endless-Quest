v0.0.1

Took the bare bones (particularly the battle aspect) of a text adventure I once made in order to make it a full-on keep fighting forever thing.

Currently done:
-> Set up the core of the game, with fighting randomly generated enemies.

Things to do:
-> Make the save function more than decorative text.
-> Adjust the random battles according to character level.
-> Allow for character classes and specialisations.
