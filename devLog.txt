v0.0.1

Took the bare bones (particularly the battle aspect) of a text adventure I once made in order to make it a full-on keep fighting forever thing.

Currently done:
-> Set up the core of the game, with fighting randomly generated enemies. Plot started.
-> Added three basic classes - Warrior, Mage, Rogue. Specialisations considered, subject to change.

Things to do:
-> Make the save function more than decorative text.
-> For the initialise opponent function, instead give id numbers to monsters that can be used to directly find and pull them into the battle set. (this will be useful when the roster of monsters increases)
-> Adjust the random battles according to character level. -- in progress, number of opponents has been cut down according to player level
-> Allow for character classes and specialisations. -- in progress
-> Change randomised opponents according to area of battle.

Things to fix:
-> Post the list of enemies before the battle starts so that battle strategy can be decided.
-> Post character HP and MP for each turn.
-> Increase the barrier for levelling up.

Future things:
-> Include alternate language options? Or at least prepare for the possibility by making displayed lines an English language choice.
